# UniversityDatabase

The user can log in using their user ID associated with their category (student, faculty, or staff). Each category has different ways that they can interact with the database:

Students can enroll/deroll themselves into/out of courses, view their grades in courses they are currently enrolled in, and view information about staff members and faculty members minus their user IDs.

Faculty members can update the grades of students enrolled in courses that they are teaching. They are also allowed to view information about their students including their user IDs.

Staff members can add and delete users. They can also update the information of existing users and perform search queries to view their information including their user IDs.
